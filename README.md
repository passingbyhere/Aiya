# Sandwich Stacker

## What it is
  We present to you a game where the player will have to stack ingredients on their bread to complete a sandwich. There are three leevls, breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Each ingredient will be worth a certain number of points and each level will require a certain amount of points needed to move on to the next one. As the level progresses, the number of points required will increase. Starting from the lunch level, bad ingredients will also be falling down and result in point deductions if the sandwich the player has created contains any.
  
## How it works
  The player uses the mouse (moving it left and right) to control where the bread goes to catch the falling ingredients. 

## Launch Instructions
  Open Sandwich_Stacker.pde on processing. Press on the run button (the triangle button) to start.

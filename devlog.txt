Lisa & Elaina: We went to the CS Dojo, one of the best/most helpful sessions we've ever been to. SHOUT OUT TO BILLY FOR HELPING US A LOT!!! We fixed the problem of having the ingredients falling simultaneously into falling one after another (by checking if the ingredient that is currently falling is displayed 1/2 way). We also got ingredients to stack on top of one another. We see the lighttt.

NEW PROJECT IDEA: Sandwich Stacker

Jobs most crucial:
	Create Ingredients class. The Ingredients class will be used to drop ingredients from the top of the screen.
	Create Player class. The Player class will create a stack of the ingredients (aka sandwich) and check if there are enough points to move on to the next level.

Components for core functionality:
	Ingredients must fall. 
	Ingredients must stack when ingredients fall on top of sandwich.
	Player must be able to move the plate side by side.

Tasks that can be delegated, and collaboratively tackled:

	Solo - setting up the basic instance variables for Ingredients and Player class.
	Collaboratively - making the animation of the ingredients falling.

Timeline:
	Create Ingredients and Player class.
	Work on ingredients class (have the ingredients fall).
	Create plate for Player class.
	Make sure ingredients can stack on the plate.
	Create points, strike, and level system.
	Create more levels.
